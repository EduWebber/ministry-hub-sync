# Solution Summary: Designacoes Endpoint Issue

## Problem Identified
The `/api/designacoes/generate` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the message:
```
"Could not find the 'congregacao_id' column of 'designacoes' in the schema cache"
```

## Root Cause
This is a known Supabase issue where the schema cache is out of sync with the actual database schema. The `designacoes` table does have a `congregacao_id` column (as confirmed in the migration files), but the Supabase schema cache doesn't recognize it.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Updated `backend/.env` with the correct Supabase service role key
- Verified that the backend can connect to Supabase successfully

### 2. Test Data Preparation
- Fixed student-congregation associations by updating 5 students to belong to the "Congregação Central" congregation
- Verified that the congregation exists and has active students

### 3. Error Handling Improvement
- Enhanced error handling in `backend/routes/designacoes.js` to catch schema cache issues
- Added user-friendly error messages that explain the temporary nature of the problem

## Current Status
The endpoint now returns a clear error message:
```
"O sistema está passando por uma atualização de esquema. Por favor, tente novamente em alguns minutos."
```

## Complete Solution
To fully resolve this issue, the Supabase schema cache needs to be refreshed:

1. Log in to the Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the project
3. Go to the "API" or "Database" section
4. Look for an option to "Refresh schema cache" or "Reset schema cache"
5. Click the refresh button

After refreshing the schema cache, the designacoes endpoint should work correctly.

## Verification Steps
After refreshing the schema cache, you can verify the fix by:

1. Running the test script: `node test-designacoes-api.cjs`
2. Using curl: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/designacoes/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"programacao_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "congregacao_id": "7e90ac8e-d2f4-403a-b78f-55ff20ab7edf"}'
   ```

The endpoint should return a successful response with generated assignments.
